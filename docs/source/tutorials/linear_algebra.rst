Linear Algebra
===============

Linear algebra is fundamental to arguably most of scientific computation. ProbNum defines (finite-dimensional) linear
operators in a memory-efficient manner and implements probabilistic numerical methods to solve linear systems.

See the notebooks below to learn more about linear algebra in ProbNum.
